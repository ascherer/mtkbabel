# MTKBabel — Tool for managing i-Blue 747 GPS data logger.

This is a clone of [Niccolo Rigacci’s project on
SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mtkbabel/).

I’m using the packaged installation of mtkbabel 0.8.3.1 for Kubuntu 12.04 LTS
and apply the slight modifications from the ‘local’ branch.

## Getting Started

Details of this software can be found in the [README](README) file.
